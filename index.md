# Welcome to Dog Linux
---    
<br>

<p class='colblock' markdown='1'>
*DebianDog is very small Debian Live CD shaped to look and act like Puppy Linux. Debian structure and Debian behaviour are untouched and Debian documentation is 100% valid for DebianDog. You have access to all debian repositories using apt-get or synaptic.*
</p>

All "DebianDog" projects (and deratives) are collected here, part of [DebianDog Organization on Github](https://github.com/DebianDog/ "Join the DebianDog Organization!"){:target="_blank"}

##### [*Our thanks to Daniel Baumann! DebianDog wouldn't exist without his work.*](https://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2015/11/msg00024.html "An abrupt End to Debian Live"){:target="_blank"}
